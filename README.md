Phone DApp README
Introduction
This project is a decentralized application (dApp) for managing phone purchases and testing smart contracts. 
It consists of two main components: phone_main.move and phone_test.move. The phone_main.move contains the smart contracts for handling phone purchases on the blockchain,
while phone_test.move contains the test suite for ensuring the correctness of the contracts. 

Running the Application

phone_main.move
Deploying smart contracts:

Use the Move IDE or the Move CLI tool to compile and deploy the phone_main.move contracts to the desired blockchain network.
Interacting with the dApp:

Once the contracts are deployed, users can interact with the dApp through a compatible wallet or Web3 provider.

phone_test.move
Testing smart contracts:
Run the Move test suite to verify the correctness of the smart contracts in phone_main.move:
